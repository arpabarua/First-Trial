### Handlebars
With Handlebars, the generation of HTML can be seperated from the rest of the JavaScript and write cleaner code.

### Adding it to project
Just go to [handlebars homepage](http://handlebarsjs.com/) , and click the download button to get the latest version. Now all you have to do is to include the library in your html with a regular `<script>` tag.
You can also use a CDN-hosted version, which has the added benefit that the same file might be cached already in the visitor's browser, if it has been used by another website.

```javascript
// From File
<script src="handlebars-v2.0.0.js"></script>
// From CDN
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/2.0.0/handlebars.js"></script>
```


### Inky
Inky is an HTML-based templating language that converts simple HTML into complex, responsive email-ready HTML.

### Sass
Sass is a meta-language on top of CSS that’s used to describe the style of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS allows. Sass both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and implements various features that are useful for creating manageable stylesheets.
while normal CSS doesn’t yet allow things like variables, mixins (reusable blocks of styles), etc. Sass provides a syntax that does all of that and more—enabling “super functionality” in addition to normal CSS.

### BrowserSync
BrowserSync makes tweaking and testing faster by synchronizing file changes and interactions across many devices.

### Npm
* Node package manager

  * npm can manage packages that are local dependencies of a particular project, as well as globally-installed JavaScript tools. When used as a dependency manager for a local project, npm can install, in one command, all the dependencies of a project through the package.json file.
